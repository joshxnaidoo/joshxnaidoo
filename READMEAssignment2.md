## Tamagotchi App Creation Process

### Beginning:

Inspired by the iconic Tamagotchi toys of the 1990s, the Tamagotchi App was born out of a nostalgic need to relive the joys of virtual pet ownership. The objective was to create a mobile application that will entertain and engage users while encapsulating the essence of pet ownership.

### Initial Position:

1. Starting the Project:
   I opened Android Studio and made a new project called "TamagotchiApp" for Android.
   - Specified the layout files, drawable resources, and Kotlin source code files that make up the project structure.

     2. First Screen Layout:
   - Created a straightforward layout for the welcome screen (MainActivity) with a start button to initiate the pet care process.
   Determined that in order to house the interactive pet care elements, a second screen (MainActivity2) was required.

### Iterations in Development:

1. Installation of the Welcome Screen:
   - Developed MainActivity's welcome screen feature.
   - Using intents, the start button logic was implemented to switch to MainActivity2.
   - Based on testing and user input, the UI design and functionality were improved iteratively.
  
   2. Creation of Interactive Screens:
   - MainActivity2 was made to function as the interactive screen for pet care.
   - Created the user interface (UI) components for the feeding, cleaning, and playing action buttons and the pet stats display.
   - Put into practice the algorithm that uses user actions to update pet data and show matching graphics.
   - To guarantee seamless operation, the interactive features were tested.

### Difficulties Met:

1. Including UI Components:
   - Had trouble at first handling user interactions and merging UI elements.
   - Solved problems by consulting with Android developer resources and conducting experiments.
2. Intent Implementation: - Had trouble putting intentions into practice to move between MainActivity and MainActivity2. - To guarantee smooth screen transitions, the purpose logic was examined and improved.

### Final Thought:

The Tamagotchi App's development process required overcoming a number of obstacles in an effort to provide an entertaining and user-friendly pet care experience. Using continuous improvement and iterative development techniques, the project went from a rough idea to a useful and entertaining application that can be used by people of all ages.
